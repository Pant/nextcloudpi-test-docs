## Where

* Your best chance at getting help and getting answers is asking questions on the [forum](https://help.nextcloud.com/c/support/appliances-docker-snappy-vm). **Please do** take the time to investigate (search), maybe your question as already been answered. Thank you!

* For general discussion you can join us at [Telegram chat group](https://t.me/NextCloudPi)

* Only bugs, issues and feature requests concerning NCP code and Wiki should be reported here on [Github](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/issues)

## How

* Please be patient, nobody "works" here or has any obligation to help, we do so because we like to do it.

* Try to be precise in describing the problems you are facing, what you are trying to achieve, steps you took, be as informative as you can. A question containing extended information, where you clearly went thru extra trouble to try gather information to make helping you easier, is likely to get a lot more response.

* Make sure you give your question a **meaningful title!** "Help me I'm a Noob or I'm stuck" is not going to raise much interest.

## Note
> By asking questions and reporting issues, we can all contribute to improving the software we are using. Thank you for contributing!
